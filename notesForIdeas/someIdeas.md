# Things to do

- make an interface for api and make it user friendly
- what if we use paste bin as an output
- add some other ways of giving out output
- a telegram bot that talks to the website is easier to program and makes lesser calls to the main api?
- what about using node to talk to the server?
- well these are some of the ideas I have right now
